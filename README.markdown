# Ecukes - Cucumber for Emacs
There are plenty of unit/regression testing tools for Emacs, and even
some for functional testing. What Emacs is missing though is a really
good testing framework for integration testing. This is where
[Ecukes](http://github.com/rejeep/ecukes) comes in.

[Cucumber](http://cukes.info/) is a great integration testing tool,
used mostly for testing web applications. Ecukes is Cucumber for
Emacs. No, it's **not** a major mode to edit feature files. It is a
package that makes it possible to write Cucumber like tests for your
Emacs packages.

Ecukes is not a complete clone of Cucumber and is not intended to
be. If however Ecukes is missing some feature that you feel really
should be included, please make a bug report.

If you don't know anything about Cucumber I suggest you read up a bit
about it before continuing with Ecukes.

See <http://ecukes.info> for more information!

## To run inside emacs

Add ecukes directory to load path. I like to keep ecukes inside my user home
directory, so I use this:

    (add-to-list 'load-path (concat user-emacs-directory user-login-name "/ecukes"))
    (require 'ecukes)

Then, open a buffer inside your elisp project and run `M-x ecukes`
